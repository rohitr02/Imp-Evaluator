# Imp-Evaluator
This is an evaluator for Imp, an imperative programming language, built in Ocaml.

## Running the Code: ##

First, check that the imp file exists. If it does not, then run ```make``` in terminal.

Once the imp file exists, run the code by navigating to this project in terminal and running ```./imp``` which will check some testcases in programs along with testcases at the end of assignment3.ml. Refer to the end of assignment3.ml to see how to run/test your own imp code.
